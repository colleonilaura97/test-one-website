    Zogno. On Thursday morning the Carabinieri of the Provincial Command of Bergamo carried out <br>
    a search decree in the home of three young men from Bergamo - B.Y. aged 22, B.C. aged 19 and <br>
     P.P. 23 years old - all resident in the upper Brembana Valley. The Provision was issued by <br>
     the Bergamo Public Prosecutor's Office. <br>

    regarding the sabotage of the Zogno vaccination hub, which took place on 26 September. <br>

    <h2><u>Higher salaries to mayors?<br> Zogno approves, Gorle has to think about it</u></h2>

    Bergamo. Since January, the allowances of mayors and local administrators have been higher. <br>
    This was foreseen by a measure taken by the Draghi government for all municipalities. <br>
Selina Odette Fedi, mayor of Zogno, explains: <br>
"As required by law, we will apply the adjustment of the mayor's and councilors' allowances <br>
progressively over the next three years. I think it is a fair measure, considering that administering <br>
involves many responsibilities. Taking care of your own municipality takes a lot of time first of all:<br>
 I, for example, spend every day in the town hall, within the morning and go out in the evening, <br>
  dedicating myself to the citizens as much as possible. For their part, the councilors support me <br>
  ensuring their commitment and following the administrative life with dedication: every day we are <br>
  at the service of the community and, in order to work well, a lot of availability is needed ". <br>
