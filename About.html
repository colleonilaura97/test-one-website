    <h2> <u>Geography</u></h2>
    
    Located in the lower portion of the Brembana Valley not far from San Pellegrino Terme (4 km), <br>
    the capital extends along the valley road, on the right orographic bank of the Brembo river, <br>

     at the foot of the north side of Canto Alto and the eastern side of Monte Zucco. <br>

    <h2> <u>History</u></h2>
    
    The area where the town stands was inhabited since prehistoric times, as evidenced by the finds <br>
    found in a local cave called "Büsa dell'Andrea". <br>
    There are documents dating back to the end of the 12th century that testify to the existence <br>
     of Zogno as a rural municipality: in the History of Zogno and some neighboring lands of Bortolo <br>
     Belotti we read that a parchment of the Monastery of Astino from 1220 mentions Giovanni Geze as "Consul" of Zogno [7]. <br>
    Zogno became an important center under the domination of Venice. In past centuries the population  <br>
    was mainly employed in agriculture, livestock breeding and pastoralism, although there was no lack <br>
    of handicraft activities related to the spinning of wool, linen and the weaving of cloths.<br>
    In the hamlet of Poscante on 18 December 1773 the famous brigand Vincenzo Pacchiana (Pacì Paciana) was born,<br>
     an Italian Robin Hood who stole from the rich and gave to the poor, called by his contemporaries: king of the road, <br>
      king of the mountains. During the 19th century, the paper and cement industries took hold. Today, thanks to constant <br>
       development, both in the economic field (important for example the Manifattura Valle Brembana, a textile industry <br>
        that still exists today, which has recently failed) and urban planning, Zogno is the most populous town in the  <br>
        brembana Valley with numerous commercial activities, textiles, mining, wood crafts and construction companies. <br>

     In a dominant position stands the fifteenth-century church of San Lorenzo, built on the ruins of the medieval <br>
    castle of the Guelph side, destroyed by the Visconti before handing it over to the Republic of Venice, <br>
    after the peace of Lodi. The interior houses the seventeenth-century series of the Mysteries of the Rosary <br>
    by Francesco Zucco, a Madonna and Child by Francesco Lavagna and a painting by Vincenzo Angelo Orelli <br>
     depicting Santa Margherita da Cortona. <br>  

   <li> <u> Museum </u></li>
    
    The Museum of the Valley, located in a seventeenth-century building in the historic center, <br>
    exhibits a rich series of finds on the agricultural and peasant society of the valley in twelve rooms. <br>
    
    <li><u>San Lorenzo Museum </u></li>
    
    Also worth mentioning is the Museum of San Lorenzo, set up in the parish church, <br>
     which collects evidence of a religious nature from the Brembana Valley. <br>
    
    <li><u>Villa Belotti </u> </li>
    
    The Zognese villa, which has housed the "Bortolo Belotti" Municipal Library since 1985, <br>
    was built in 1906 for the notary Ulisse Cacciamali by the Bergamo architect Giovanni Barboglio, <br>
     author in Zogno also of public buildings and the old staircase to the parish church, but more <br>
     famous in Lombardy for the construction or restoration of churches. <br>
