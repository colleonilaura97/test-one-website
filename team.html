    <p align="center">  Hi everyone!

   I am Laura and I was born and raised in Zogno, together with my family. <br>
 For some years now, I have been interested in the different realities of <br>
  my small town in the mountains. I have been passionate about journalism  <br>
  since I was a child and that is why I have chosen to embark on a new challenge: <br>
   Zogno News. I wanted to combine my love for the place where I grew up and my keen <br>
    interest in local newspapers. I believe it is essential to stay up to date <br>
    on the place we live in every day, before even documenting ourselves <br>
     on what is happening in the world. </p>

    <p align="center">  Hi everyone!

        I am Alessandro, born and raised in the town of Zogno. <br>
         Despite having traveled extensively both for university and for work, <br>
         I have always loved the place where I was lucky enough to live. <br>
         Together with my sister Laura, I chose to undertake this project <br>
         to underline the importance that Zogno has for me.</p>
